Hello traveler!

This is a simple HTML code for a chat interface. It consists of a chat container with a header, message display area, and a footer with an input field for sending messages.

File Structure
	-index.html: The main HTML file containing the chat interface.
	-styles.css: The CSS file for styling the chat interface.
	-user-avatar.jpg: The avatar image for the user.
	-sender-avatar.jpg: The avatar image for the sender.
Usage

1) Place the index.html file in your project directory.
2) Add the styles.css file to the same directory or update the stylesheet link in the HTML file to point to the correct location.
3) Replace the user-avatar.jpg and sender-avatar.jpg images with your desired avatar images, keeping the same filenames.
4) Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the chat interface.

Features
	*The chat interface displays incoming and outgoing messages along with timestamps.
	*Avatars are shown for both the user and the sender.
	*The footer contains an input field for typing and sending messages.
	*Feel free to modify the code and customize it according to your requirements.

Note: This is a static HTML file, and it does not include any backend or functionality for sending or receiving messages. It serves as a starting point for building a chat interface and requires further development to make it interactive.

Enjoy using the chat interface! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach ME.
