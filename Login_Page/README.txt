Hello traveler!

This HTML code represents a simple sign-up/sign-in form. It allows users to enter their name, email, and password to create an account or sign in with existing credentials.

To use this code, follow the instructions below:

1) HTML Structure:

	*The HTML structure starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the opening <html> tag.
	*The <head> section contains meta tags for character encoding, browser compatibility, and responsive design.
	*The CSS stylesheet is linked using the <link> tag. Make sure the CSS file is named "css.css" and located in the same directory as the HTML file.
	*The Font Awesome library is included using the <script> tag. It is used to display icons in the form.
	*The page title is set to "Sign In" using the <title> tag.

2) Form Elements:

	-The form is contained within a <div> element with the class "container".
	-Inside the container, there is a <div> element with the class "form-box" that wraps the form content.
	-The heading "Sign Up" is displayed as an <h1> element with the id "title".
	-The form contains three input fields: name, email, and password. Each input field is contained within a <div> element with the class "input-field".
	-The icons for each input field are added using the <i> element and Font Awesome classes.
	-The input fields have placeholders for the respective input types.
	-Below the input fields, there is a link labeled "Lost password" that points to "#" (to be customized later).
	-The buttons for sign up and sign in are represented by <button> elements with the ids "signupBtn" and "signinBtn", respectively.
	-The sign-in button initially has the class "disable" to indicate it is inactive.

3) JavaScript:

	#The JavaScript code is enclosed in <script> tags.
	#It retrieves references to the HTML elements using their ids.
	#When the sign-in button is clicked, the onclick event triggers a function that modifies the appearance of the form.
	#The name field's height is set to "0" to hide it, the title is changed to "Sign In", and the sign-in button's class is updated.
When the sign-up button is clicked, a similar function is triggered to restore the form's original state.
Make sure to customize the code according to your requirements. You can modify the form elements, add form validation, and update the link destinations as needed. Remember to create a CSS file named "css.css" for styling and ensure the Font Awesome library is accessible via the provided URL.
